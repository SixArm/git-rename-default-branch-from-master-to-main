# git-rename-master-branch-to-main

This tool helps you use git to change your git repository
from the default branch name 'master' to a new name 'main'.

This tool is intentionally step-by-step so it is suitable
for one-time use by people who may be less-familiar with git.

If you are a skilled git user, or if you have many repos and
you want to automate changing them, then you edit this tool
to remove prompts, or search the net for automation scripts.

Constructive feedback welcome.
