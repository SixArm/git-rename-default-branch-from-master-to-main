# git-rename-master-branch-to-main

This tool helps you use git to change your git repository
from the default branch name 'master' to a new name 'main'.

This tool is intentionally step-by-step so it is suitable
for one-time use by people who may be less-familiar with git.

If you are a skilled git user, or if you have many repos and
you want to automate changing them, then you edit this tool
to remove prompts, or search the net for automation scripts.

This tool can also use the GitHub API to change the default branch name.
We welcome developer help to add the Bitbucket API, GitLab API, etc.

If you use GitHub, and you want to automatically rename branches,
and especially if you want to process many repos all at once,
then you may want to try this automation tool:
[github-default-branch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-default-branch).

Constructive feedback welcome.
