# git-rename-master-branch-to-main

This tool helps you use git to change your git repository
from the default branch name 'master' to a new name 'main'.

This tool is intentionally step-by-step so it is suitable
for one-time use by people who may be less-familiar with git.

If you are a skilled git user, or if you have many repos and
you want to automate changing them, then you edit this tool
to remove prompts, or search the net for automation scripts.

If you use GitHub, and you want to automatically rename branches,
and you are skilled enough to create your GitHub personal access
token and use it, then you may want to try this automation tool:
[github-default-branch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-default-branch).

Constructive feedback welcome.
